How would you implement a performant GraphQL cache? How can we design a good algorithm for it? Is there a good Open Source solution that is efficient, scalable and easy to deploy? How is the caching key computed? What about cache invalidations? Would it be possible to deduplicate resolver execution? This might be seen as daunting but in reality is all code and algorithms. In this talk we are going to walk through a GraphQL caching system that we have developed for Mercurius - one of the fastest GraphQL servers for Node.js.
