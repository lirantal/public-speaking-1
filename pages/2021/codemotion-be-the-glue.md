I spent years perfecting my skills as a software developer because I once believed that I had to be the best in my craft to be successful and that the code always comes first. The truth is, I was wrong.

The days where a talented individual could lock themselves in their basement and ship successful software are long gone. Shipping a working application is a team business, as there is a limit to what we can develop alone.

I'm going to present to you an old/new way of building your career, and why I decided to walk the management path: Be the glue that lets your teams ship amazing products.
