Fastify is an HTTP framework for Node.js that focuses on providing a good developer experience without compromising on performance metrics. What makes Fastify special is not its technical details, but its community which is open for contributions of any kind. Part of the secret sauce is the Fastify plugin architecture that has enabled developers to write more than a hundred plugins.

This hands-on workshop is structured around a series of exercises that covers from basic “hello world” to how to structure a project, perform database access and authentication.
