You are watching from the sides, dreaming about building the next (popular?) framework or library in your field. You dream about presenting your creation in front of hundreds of people at [NameOfConference]. You believe in yourself, and all of a sudden you have thousands of downloads per month and developers relying on you to maintain your library. You think you made it, instead it all starts here.
What does make an Open Source library or framework successful? Can something become popular just because itâ€™s technologically superior, or shows a clear innovation path? A single maintainer can only do so much, trying to divide their time between adding new features, bug fixes, and dependency updates.
Maintaining a successful Open Source project is too much of a burden for a single individual, often working on its own time. You need something else, you need a community.
