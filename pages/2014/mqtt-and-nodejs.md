MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this talk, we discuss what problems it solves, why the IoT need such a protocol, and the Node.js implementation!

MQTT has been around for 20 years, but it is getting a lot of hype recently because it has almost no overhead, it is FAST, and it supports an offline mode.

Using MQTT, you are now able to send and receive messages to and from things, directly in your Javascript application, both in Node.js and in the browser.
You can even receive the messages from your thing if you are offline, just when you connect back!
