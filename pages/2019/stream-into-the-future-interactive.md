There was a time when Node.js streams were all the rage but over time the Node.js Core Streams
codebase became extremely complex and hard to understand. Worse still, WHATWG introduced an API
for browser Streams. The two Streams APIâ€™s are incompatible with each other and both are complex
and leaky abstractions. In this talk, a Node.js Core Streams maintainer presents a stream-less
future by demonstrating how to use pure JavaScript: Async Iterators and Generators can give us
everything Streams can while being completely cross-platform and highly performant.
