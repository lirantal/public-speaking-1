One of the more difficult concepts to grasp when debugging a Node.js application is the flow of asynchronous context.
To make it easier for us, we have created a new open source visualization tool that brings the Node.js asynchronous flow to life.
This talk will dive deep into trace events, async_hooks, and context tracking through a Node.js process.
We will show that while the amount of data is staggering, it is possible to visualize it through.. bubbles!
