It’s been weeks and the organization you work for seems to be slowly turning against you.
At least that’s what it feels like. User experience is poor because of slow API’s,
sales are being missed, performance-linked SEO heuristics are causing a drop in page ranking.
Mobile users have all but given up. Operations have reported that a critical Node.js service
owned by your team is spinning at 70-100% CPU, and all parts of the application dependent on
the service are experiencing intermittent slowdowns or in some cases, complete unavailability.
What are you going to do now?

In this talk we’ll present a new and straightforward way to identify bottlenecks in Node.js and beyond.
