"MQTT" is a publish/subscribe protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this talk, we discuss what problems it solves, why the IoT need such a protocol, and the "Node.js" implementations!
"MQTT" has been around for 20 years, but it is getting a lot of hype recently because it has almost no overhead, it is FAST, and it supports an offline mode.
Using "MQTT", you are now able to send and receive messages to and from things, directly in your "javascript" application, both in "Node.js" and the browser.
You can even receive the messages from your thing if you are offline, just when you connect back!

You can find all the software cited in the presentation in the following links:

Update: The "MQTT-over-websocket" that was presented in the talk is now released and integrated into "Mosca".
