Sunday morning and your phone rings: production is down.
After two hours, you manage to solve it: you could have fixed it in one minute
if you had the right information from the start. To avoid this issue you add logging everywhere,
then your application requires twice as many servers to run.
This talk is for you: Learn about [Pino](https://www.getpino.io). It logs in JSON, and itâ€™s up to 17 times faster
than traditional loggers, and it comes with nice Express and Hapi integrations.
