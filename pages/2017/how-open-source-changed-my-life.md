At some point in my career I decided I wanted to quit software development and do an MBA. For a stroke of luck, I failed the admission test and I kept developing software. It was early 2010, and I did not know Node.js existed, and the impact it would have on my life.

I wanted to speak at conferences, and I was terrible at it.

Then, I was lucky to find a job that allowed me time to develop Open Source libraries. I was lucky that someone noticed one, and I went speaking at NodeConf.eu 2013.

Now I travel the world as a consultant and conference speaker, and I maintain close to 200 OSS libraries. Open Source can change your life too, because there is no such thing as luck.
